% INSTRUCTIONS: Please fill out the below template with the most pertinent and recent work for each section. The
%               purpose of this resume is to give employers a very brief overview of what different students are

%               The idea is that after reviewing this document, they will request more information on students 
%               that seem like a good fit for what they are looking for so there is no need to be verbose here.
%               Just a short and susinct description of what you are doing and what you are looking for in an 
%               intenship/job.
