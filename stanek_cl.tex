% INSTRUCTIONS: Add the pertinent keywords from the list below to the line that begins with "\noindent"
%               Please only use the keywords from the list below. 

% E.g. If you are interested in appliying data science to specific applications in academia the command would look 
%      something like:

% \noindent data science, applications, academia

% List of possible keywords (Please take ONLY the keywords from this list, do not add your own):
% computational modeling
% data science
% algorithms
% applications
% industry
% national lab
% academia
% non-profit

To whom it may concern:\\

My name is Lucas Stanek, and I am a doctoral student in the Department of CMSE with an anticipated graduation date of May 2022. {\textbf{I am interested in summer internship opportunities in industry or the national laboratory system, focusing generally in areas of computational modeling with specifically in the area of or related to computational plasma physics.}} \\

Prior to joining the CMSE PhD program in Fall 2017, I received a B.S./M.S. in Applied Mathematics at The University of Akron in Akron, Ohio. My current research focuses on developing computational models to model strongly coupled plasmas, and I am generally interested in research in kinetic theory, computational fluid dynamics, and high-performance computing. I am interested in pursuing an internship to explore career paths outside of academia and to gain new technical skills and experience related to my area of focus, and would be interested in pursuing opportunities in all areas of computational modeling.\\

My resume is included with this letter, and I can be contacted at \href{mailto:staneklu@msu.edu}{staneklu@msu.edu}.\\

Sincerely, \\
